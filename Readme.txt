
## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure the dataset file `Mall_Customers.csv` is present in the same directory as the Python script `customer_segmentation.py`. If the file is located elsewhere, provide the correct path to the file in the script.

3. Run the Python script `customer_segmentation.py`.

4. The program will display the Elbow Method graph to help choose the optimal number of clusters. Then, it will visualize the clusters and centroids on a scatter plot.

5. The program will also display the dataset with cluster labels appended.
